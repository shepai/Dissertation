abstract = {Four axle vehicles with bogies can adapt the position of the wheels to follow irregularities in the terrain, having an obstacle surpassing ability far greater than conventional 2-axle vehicles. Still, the ability to overcome discrete obstacles on a steep slope is very different depending on the wheel that is facing the obstacle. A possible solution to diminish this variation can be found if the vehicle is able to actively redistribute the load on each wheel. One strategy is to design the suspension mechanism so it can regulate its height, being able to level the chassis. Also, an active torque on the pin join between the bogie and the chassis can be applied with the same goal, adopting a system of active bogies. Both solutions have been parametrically studied in a bi-dimensional multibody model of a 4-axle vehicle with double bogies. The results show an improvement independent of obstacle position and terrain angle when using active bogies. With height regulation, this improvement is limited to the rear bogie wheels, but the obstacle surmounting capacity of the vehicle as a whole can be considerably increased if the optimal regulation point is found. Possible applications for such enhanced vehicles with bogies are performing different tasks in forest areas with obstacles on steep slopes or unstructured terrain exploration.}

This is the aim of the performance optimization tool (POT) presented in this paper. The POT enables the comparison and optimization of a rover chassis in a quick and efficient way. The tool is based on a static approach including optimization of the wheel torques in order to maximize traction. Tests with real hardware were performed to validate the POT. Two different rovers, CRAB and RCL-E, were assessed in simulation and hardware with respect to specific, well defined metrics. In simulation, their performances were compared to the rocker-bogie-type rover MER. CRAB and MER showed similar performance, while RCL-E had significant problems with the benchmark obstacle. A very good match between simulation results and real measurements was achieved. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have explored the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to the control of complex nonlinear and time varying industrial processes. However RL algorithms use exploratory actions to learn an optimal control policy and converge slowly while popular inverse model ANN based control strategies require extensive training data to learn the inverse model of complex nonlinear systems. In this paper a novel approach that avoids the need for extensive training data to construct an exact inverse model in the inverse ANN approach, the need for an exact and stable inverse to exist and the need for exhaustive and costly exploration in pure RL based strategies is proposed. In this approach an initial approximate control policy learnt by an artificial neural network is refined using a reinforcement learning strategy. This Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) strategy is applied to the economically important problem of control of a semi-continuous batch-fed bioreactor used for yeast fermentation. The bioreactor control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved using pure RL and PSRL algorithms. Model based and model-free RL control experiments and simulations are used to demonstrate the superior performance of the PSRL strategy compared to the pure RL and inverse model ANN based control strategies on a variety of performance metrics.}

abstract = {Summary
The ability of bees and ants to learn long visually guided routes in complex environments is perhaps one of the most spectacular pieces of evidence for the impressive power of their small brains. Whereas flying bees can visit flowers in an optimized sequence over kilometers, walking solitary foraging ants can precisely recapitulate routes of up to 100 m in complex environments [1]. It is clear that route following depends largely on learned visual information and we have a good idea of how visual memories can guide individuals along them [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], as well as how this is implemented in the insect brain [7, 8]. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control route learning and development. Here we show that ants (Melophorus bagoti and Cataglyphis fortis) navigating in their natural environments can actively learn a route detour to avoid a pit trap. This adaptive flexibility depends on a mechanism of aversive learning based on memory traces of recently encountered stimuli, reflecting the laboratory paradigm of trace conditioning. The views experienced before falling into the trap become associated with the ensuing negative outcome and thus trigger salutary turns on the subsequent trip. This drives the ants to orient away from the goal direction and avoid the trap. If the pit trap is avoided, the novel views experienced during the detour become positively reinforced and the new route crystallizes. We discuss how such an interplay between appetitive and aversive memories might be implemented in insect neural circuitry.}
